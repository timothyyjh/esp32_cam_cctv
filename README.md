# esp32_cam_cctv
A documentation of a DIY CCTV based on the ESP32 Cam module.

This project implements a basic level of security. It uses the ESP32 Cam module which I programmed through the Arduino IDE using C and utilizes a motion sensor, activating and grabbing images when there is motion detected and sending it to me through Telegram. It is built ontop a breadboard which is powered through a USB adapter through the FTDI USB to TTL Serial converter.

This is how it looks like:
